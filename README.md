Prediction of Cervical Cancer

1.	Introduction
More than 12,000 women in the United States gets diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, and more than 4,000 of them die. Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer for women worldwide, but because it develops over time, it is also one of the most preventable types of cancer. Cancer of the cervix tends to occur during midlife. Half of the women diagnosed with the disease are between 35 and 55 years of age. It rarely affects women under age 20, and approximately 20 percent of diagnoses are made in women older than 65. For this reason, it is important for women to continue cervical cancer screening until at least the age of 70.
For this project we have used 4 different types of tests to detect the cervical cancer. There 4 tests are Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology, Biopsy.

1.1.	Hinselmann Colposcopy (Ancient Greek: translit. kolpos, lit. 'hollow, womb, vagina' + skopos "look at") is a medical diagnostic procedure to examine an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix and the tissues of the vagina and vulva. Many premalignant lesions and malignant lesions in these areas have discernible characteristics which can be detected through the examination. It is done using a colposcope, which provides an enlarged view of the areas, allowing the colposcopist to visually distinguish normal from abnormal appearing tissue and take directed biopsies for further pathological examination. The main goal of colposcopy is to prevent cervical cancer by detecting precancerous lesions early and treating them. The procedure was developed by the German physician Hans Hinselmann, with help from Eduard Wirths. The development of colposcopy involved experimentation on Jewish inmates from Auschwitz. A specialized colposcope equipped with a camera is used in examining and collecting evidence for victims of rape and sexual assault.

1.2.	In Schiller Schiller's iodine solution is applied to the cervix under direct vision. Normal cervical mucosa contains glycogen and stains brown, whereas abnormal areas, such as early cervical cancer, do not take up the stain. The abnormal areas can then be biopsied and examined histologically. The composition of Schiller's iodine is the same as Lugol's iodine, the latter being more concentrated. When Schiller's iodine is not available, Lugol's iodine can be used as an alternative.Schiller's test is not specific for cervical cancer, as areas of inflammation, ulceration and keratosis may also not take up the stain.

1.3.	In Citology Cells, that were once invisible to the naked eye, became visible in 17th century Europe with the invention of the compound microscope. Robert Hooke was the first person to term the building block of all living organisms as "cells" after looking at cork. The cell theory states that all living things are made up cells. The theory also states that both plants and animals are composed of cells which was confirmed by plant scientist, Matthias Schleiden and animal scientist, Theodor Schwann in 1839. 19 years later, Rudolf Virchow contributed to the cell theory, arguing that all cells come from the division of preexisting cells In recent years, there have been many studies which question the cell theory. Scientists have struggled to decide whether viruses are alive or not. Viruses lack common characteristics of a living cell, such as membranes, cell organelles, and the ability to reproduce by themselves. Viruses range from 0.005 to .03 microns in size whereas Bacteria range from 1-5 microns. The late 19th century indicates the birth of cytology.[citation needed] Modern day cell biology research looks at different ways to culture and manipulate cells outside of a living body to further research in human anatomy and physiology, to derive treatments and other medications, etc. The techniques by which cells are studied have evolved. Advancement in microscopic techniques and technology such as fluorescence microscopy, phase-contrast microscopy, dark field microscopy, confocal microscopy, cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, etc. have allowed scientists to get a better idea of the structure of cells. 

These are the main branches of cytology: 
•	Cytotaxonomy - The study combining cytology and taxonomy
•	Cytogenetics - The study combining cytology and genetics
•	Cell Physiology - The study combining cytology and physiology
•	Cytochemistry - The study combining cytology and biochemistry
•	Cytopathology - The study combining cytology and pathology
•	Cytoecology - The study combining cytology and ecology

1.4.	A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples a portion of the abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions.
When cancer is suspected, a variety of biopsy techniques can be applied. An excisional biopsy is an attempt to remove an entire lesion. When the specimen is evaluated, in addition to diagnosis, the amount of uninvolved tissue around the lesion, the surgical margin of the specimen is examined to see if the disease has spread beyond the area biopsied. "Clear margins" or "negative margins" means that no disease was found at the edges of the biopsy specimen. "Positive margins" means that disease was found, and a wider excision may be needed, depending on the diagnosis.
When intact removal is not indicated for a variety of reasons, a wedge of tissue may be taken in an incisional biopsy. In some cases, a sample can be collected by devices that "bite" a sample. A variety of sizes of needle can collect tissue in the lumen (core biopsy). Smaller diameter needles collect cells and cell clusters, fine needle aspiration biopsy. 
Pathologic examination of a biopsy can determine whether a lesion is benign or malignant, and can help differentiate between different types of cancer. In contrast to a biopsy that merely samples a lesion, a larger excisional specimen called a resection may come to a pathologist, typically from a surgeon attempting to eradicate a known lesion from a patient. For example, a pathologist would examine a mastectomy specimen, even if a previous nonexcisional breast biopsy had already established the diagnosis of breast cancer. Examination of the full mastectomy specimen would confirm the exact nature of the cancer (subclassification of tumor and histologic "grading") and reveal the extent of its spread (pathologic "staging").


2.	Problem Definition 
Cervical cancer kills 260,000 women annually, and nearly 85% of these deaths occur in developing nations, where it is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Disparities of health and poverty play a large role in this high mortality rate. Whereas routine Papanicolaou and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has dramatically reduced cervical cancer deaths in Western nations, without proper infrastructure, facilities, and medical training, the rates of cervical cancer in developing nations will remain high. Studies on HPV DNA testing and the low-technology method of “screen and treat” are promising. In addition, reducing the cost and increasing the availability of HPV vaccines in developing nations brings hope and promise to the next generation of women.

No woman should die of cervical cancer in this day and age, yet each year more than 260,000 women do, mostly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The dramatic disparity in incidence rates between high- and low-income countries is due primarily to differential access to effective screening and precancer, or preventive, treatment; similar disparities also exist within countries. International gaps will widen further if use of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine continues to lag in LMICs. Even with relatively low rates of use in the United States, we are already seeing dramatic benefits from vaccination in terms of reductions in rates of HPV infection and early cervical disease. Thanks in part to herd immunity for people not yet reached by the vaccine, and new vaccines that include more HPV types, there’s a good chance that, in the not-too-distant future, current and future generations of adolescent girls will be largely spared from cervical cancer. Eventually — after several decades — cervical cancer screening may no longer be warranted. But that is not yet the case. Hundreds of millions of women are already beyond the age of vaccination, and without screening and preventive treatment, some 19 million will die from cervical cancer over the next 40 years. We know from experience that the successful methods used to reduce incidence in high-income countries (Pap smear, colposcopy, biopsy) aren’t feasible at scale in low-resource settings. The basic tools for effective cervical cancer screening already exist and are getting better each year, but they are still out of reach for millions of women living in LMICs. Yet we believe that innovative approaches and emerging international commitment make it possible to ensure that all women have access to these lifesaving cancer-prevention tools.One notable advance in screening methods is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), which allows trained health workers to spot cervical abnormalities with just a speculum exam. We now also have highly sensitive molecular tests that detect HPV infection or its consequences — the precursors to cervical cancer. Molecular testing technology continues to progress, and though some of these tests require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, others are closer to the point-of-care or lower-infrastructure models that can be implemented in LMICs. Both VIA and molecular testing are now recognized as acceptable screening methods by the World Health Organization (WHO), with HPV testing preferred wherever possible.

Tests used in this project to detect Cervical Cancer problem:
Cervical cancer can often be found early, and sometimes even prevented entirely, by having regular Pap tests. If detected early, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable cancers. Cervical cancer was once one of the most common causes of cancer death for American women. The cervical cancer death rate dropped significantly with the increased use of the Pap test. (This screening procedure can find changes in the cervix before cancer develops. It can also find cervical cancer early − when it's small and easier to cure.) But it has not changed much over the last 15 years.Cervical cancer tends to occur in midlife and is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 35 and 44. It rarely develops in women younger than 20. Many older women do not realize that the risk of developing cervical cancer is still present as they age. More than 15% of cases of cervical cancer are found in women over 65 . However, these cancers rarely occur in women who have been getting regular tests to screen for cervical cancer before they were 65. See Can cervical cancer be prevented? and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Early Detection for more information about tests used to screen for cervical cancer. In the United States, Hispanic women are most likely to get cervical cancer, followed by African-Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders, and whites. American Indians and Alaskan natives have the lowest risk of cervical cancer in this country.

4. Proposed Methods
Before applying any model to our dataset, we need to see if the quality is good enough. We need to look for any missing values, outliers etc. Then, the data set is divided into training data and validation set. A model is then applied to the training data and cross validated using the validation data. Below are the steps which were done:
Data Exploration:
Data exploration was done on the original dataset to find out the missing values, relationship between the features and between features and the outcome variables.
Our dataset had “?” instead of missing values. Below is the visualization showing the extent of missing values.
 
We could not find correlation between the variables as most of the variables were categorical. We visualized relationship between the features and the outcome variables using the below visualization:
 

Data Pre-processing:
We removed the “?” marks and replaced them with NAs. There were a lot of rows which had NA values for many columns so removed such rows. Then, the NAs were replaced with the median values of the columns.  Below is the summary of the data pre-processing part that was done.
	Removed rows with most of the features having missing values (105 rows)
	Removed columns 
		STDs
		STDs (number)
		STDs: Number of diagnosis	
		STDs: Time since first diagnosis	
		STDs: Time since last diagnosis
	Data Imputation for the missing values
Calculated median for columns and replaced them with missing values.                                     		
For categorical variables, it's like replacing them with max count of 0 or 1.	
	Over Sampling done on 1s
Algorithms Used:
We decided to apply two algorithms: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). 



5.	RESULTS
Logistic regression
•	For all the four response variables, Logistic regression gives the highest accuracy as can be seen in the above table.
•	The accuracy for SVM is comparatively lower than logistic regression because logistic regression is a probabilistic approach to data analysis.
•	Also, Logistic regression allows the interpretability of different predictors on the response variables.
•	The no. of years, a female uses hormonal contraceptives and a female diagnosed with HIV1 is directly proportional to the probability of female having cervical cancer. 
•	Also, these two predictors weigh the most in terms of predicting cervical cancer according to logistic regression model implemented.
•	Using oversampling approach, the model’s accuracy decreased from the original model (without oversampling). Though, the accuracy decreased but it allowed better prediction of the minor class i.e. prediction of females with cervical cancer.
•	One of the shortcoming of the models even after oversampling approach is that specificity of the model is very low as compared to sensitivity highlighting relatively poor prediction of females with cervical cancer.
6.	FUTURE SCOPE
•	Associative clustering can be used to predict the response variables and may help in increasing the specificity of the model. It can also be used to compare the select predictors carrying most weight to determine the response variables (prediction of cervical cancer).
•	Increasing the probability of the 1’s that is prediction of cervical cancer will increase the specificity of the model and maybe result in decrease in accuracy. This depends upon the result; the user wants to determine with accuracy.
•	Further oversampling of 1’s than the ratio of 50/50 % can also increase the specificity of the model
•	The data available is very limited and increasing the set of samples will surely help in better modelling the prediction of cervical cancer. Also, Random forests can also be used with more samples of data.
